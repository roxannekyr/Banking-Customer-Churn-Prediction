1. Column CustomerID is reduntant in regards to our target column Churn, and thus removed from dataset.
2. Age column doesn't have any clear impact in our target column Churn but has a relevance with columns YearsWithBank & Savings.
   -Age of customers to have min 25 and max 55 seems normal. We don't see for example any outlier Age=3 or Age=130.
3. Gender column doesn't have any impact in target column Churn.
   -Gender customers distribution is almost equal. Female customers are slightly more (1521 & 50,7%) than Male customers (1479 & 49,3%) by 1,4%.
   -Churn rate ratio for both 'churn=yes' and 'churn=no' for both Female & Male are nearly the same. So, column is
    not needed for Target Column Churn, and thus removed.
4. Marital Status column appears to have a small impact on whether a customer churns.
  - Most customers are single (40,5%) & married (40,4%). Single are slightly more than married customers by 0,1%.
  - A few customers are widowed (10,03%) and divorced (9%).
  - Widowed are slightly more than divorced customers by 1,03%.
  - Singles churn ratio is about 40-45%. Married churn ratio appears very close to singles churn ratio from Countplot.
  - Churn rate ratio for both 'churn=yes' and 'churn=no'for all 4 groups appears in general similar. It appers to be a 5% gap between Divorced/Single in the churn rate ratio for "churn=yes".
5. Loan Status column doesn't appear to have a clear impact in our target column Churn.
  - Most loan status are approved (60%). Approximately half dynamic of the approved, have the rejected ones(31%) and follow at last a few defaulted ones(9%).
  - Churn rate ratio for both 'churn=yes' and 'churn=no' for all 4 groups in Countplot are very similar across all three groups.
  - Approved: A large part of these customers churned (around 40-45%).
  - Rejected: This group also has a high churn rate (around 40-45%).
  - Defaulted: This group also has a high churn rate (around 50%).
  - Customers of Approved loan status are leaving at nearly the same high rate as Defaulted and Rejected.
6. Account Type appears do not have a significant impact on whether a customer churns - as between all types of accounts for 'churn rate=yes' values there seems to be a deviation +-2% -, and this is the reason why this column is dropped from dataset.
  - The majority of Account Types are savings accounts (41%). Next follow checking accounts (29%), investment (20%) & joint (10%).
7. YearsWithBank appears to be the best predictor for target column Churn.
  - YearsWithBank min=1 is considered normal as this refers to new customers.
  - Percentile of 75% is 10 years, meaning 75% of the customers have been with the bank for 10 years or less.
  - There was a value equal to 100, which was an outlier and such row was dropped from the dataset.
  - Customers with the longest years within the bank (20 years), have the highest churn rate. This means that they may feel neglected or that their long-term needs are not being met by the bank (Countplot insight).
  - For the 20 years group, the customers that churned are 37% and the customers that didn't churn 63%. Meaning 58,7% from customers of the 20 years group churned.
8. Income column doesn't have any visible impact in our target column Churn and this is the reason why this column is dropped from dataset.
  - The ratio of the 'churn=yes' bar to the 'churn=no' bar— appears in Countplot similar across all four income groups.
  - Customers, regardless of their income group -Poor or Rich- are churning at a similar rate (Poor 30% and Rich 32%).
9. Savings column doesn't appear to have a visible clear impact in our target column Churn but due to the outliers found 304 rows that werte not dropped, this column is kept in the dataset.
  - More specifically, savings column has 304 rows appearing outliers, representing about 10% of Dataset.
  - Customers, regardless of their savings group, per Counterplot are churning at a similarly high rate.
10. Loan Amount column doesn't have any impact in our target column Churn, thus it is decided to be removed from Dataset.
  - Customers regardless of their loan amount, apper to churn at a similarly high rate.
11. Credit Score column doesn't have any visible impact in our target column Churn, thus it is decided to be removed from Dataset.
  - CreditScore column mean and median are almost identical, meaning that customers are distributed close to score 700.
  - The proportion of customers who churn appears to be consistent, whether they have a 600 or 800 credit score.
12. Majority of customers that haven't churned represent the 70%, while customers that churned represent the 30%.
