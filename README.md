<h1>Bank Customer Churn Analysis & Feature Selection</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
An end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on identifying risk factors for bank customer churn. This project involves rigorous data cleaning, outlier detection, and statistical feature selection to isolate high-impact variables.

Key Highlights: 

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values via median imputation and standardized categorical inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Identified and removed non-predictive features (e.g., Gender, Income, Credit Score) based on low variance in churn ratios.

Key Insight: Discovered that long-term customers (20+ years tenure) represent the highest churn risk, contradicting the assumption that tenure equals loyalty.
<h2>Tools used in this project:</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Numpy</b>
- <b>Matplotlib</b>
- <b>Seaborn</b>
